Patient_Locator
===============

This is a simple patient lookup utility.  You enter the name and will be provided with a click to dial URL or printable
extension to contact an assigned patient care nurse.  

For click to dial use, you need a softphone app or CTI integration to your phone system.

This is the first build so it's pretty crude.  Don't critique, just contribute.
